Current issues:

I want to build up arbitrary tuples to form our AST.

  Problem:

    Return type of a single yacc rule apparently have to be the same(?)
    How can I get around this?

    I want to dump whatever structure I have at the moment to test.
    Unfortunately ocaml does have a "dump"?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!

    There is a third-party library called "extlib" which contains a module Std which has a "dump", but...
    
      !!! using external libraries in ocaml is a confusing pain in the ass
