<h1>Programming Language Model</h1>
<hr>

<h2>State Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A defect is an instruction/data interaction the full effects of which are
      not well-defined by the language or perfectly controlled by the application.
  <li>Software is written by humans.
  <li>Humans are imperfect.
  <li>Therefore, all software contains defects.
  <li>The likelihood that
  <li>Most if not all defects are diagnosable given the proper information.
  <li>It is possible to define a general framework for describing a
      programming language.
  <li>Using this framework it would be possible to create models describing
      optimal, correct constructs for programming languages in general, and
      specific languages.
</ul>

<h2>Assert</h2>
<p>
Given such a model M(L) for programming language L and a program P(L)
it should be possible to detect, diagnose and fix defects.

<h2>Model Description</h2>

<p>
Let a programming language L be an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computer_science)">interface</a>
to an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_machine">abstract machine</a>
for which the following properties are well-defined:

  <ul>
    <li>scoping
    <li>type(s)
    <li>storage
    <li>values
    <li>functions that modify scoping, types, storage, values and functions(*)
  </ul>

<p>
Such that a program P would be a directed graph of instruction calls

<p>
Consider integer arithmetic as an example of a very simple, practical programming
language:

  <ul>
    <li>scoping: (none)
    <li>type: integer
    <li>storage: one single integer
    <li>values: literal integers
    <li>functions: + - * /
  </ul>

<p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Interface</dt>
  <dd>Part of a component exposed to the outside world</dd>

  <dt>Abstract Machine</dt>
  <dd class="unsure">Need a decent definition in here</dd>
</dl>

<p>
<h3>Scoping</h3>

<h4>Definition</h4>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Consider a program P as a directed graph G(P).
  G(P) contains one node for each distinct component of P.

  <li>
  Let us define an edge e of G(P) as a defined relationship between two
  components of program P.

  <li>
  Let us define the complexity C(P) as the size of the set of edges E(G(P))

  <li>
  Given such a model, LET US DEFINE A SCOPE as a subgraph S within G(P)
  such that the nodes S(n) within it may be addressed as a single unit.
</ul>

<p>
  <span>A Scope is a subgraph within the graph of a program.</span>
  <div><img src="graph/scoping-nested.gif"></div>

<p>
In the absence of scoping any component of a program may interact any other part.
That is, the size of set E(G(P)) is !C(P)

<p>
<b>The purpose of scoping is to reduce the complexity C(P) by limiting the
number of allowable interactions between components.</b>

<p>
<blockquote>
  "Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming."
                                          -- Brian Kernighan
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that scoping itself does not imply any one particular algorithm for
determining the accessibility between scoped components; only that such
a system exists.

<p>
Scoping algorithms include, but are not limited to, the following:

<dl>

  <dt>Global scoping</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Resolution via single, global namespace.
    <p>
    <img src="graph/scoping-global.gif">
    <p>
    <code>x</code> always resolves to the top-level symbol from any scope.
    <p>
    Psuedocode:
<div class="psuedocode">resolve(symbol):
  if Global[symbol]:
    return Global[symbol]
  <span class="comment"># failure</span>
  error(symbol + " not found")
</div>
    <p>Complexity:
    &Theta;(1). For any given symbol there is exactly one answer.
  </dd>

  <dt>Static/lexical scoping</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Resolution via declaration hierarchy.
    <p>
    <img src="graph/scoping-lexical.gif">
    <p>
    <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> are independent scopes; children of the parent scope in which <code>x</code> is declared.<br>
    <code>g.x</code> is inaccessible to scope <code>f</code><br>
    <code>g(f(x)) == f(x) == x</code>
    <p>
    Psuedocode:
<div class="psuedocode">resolve(symbol, declContext):
  <span class="comment"># check decl</span>
  if declContext.declare[symbol]:
    return declContext.declare[symbol]
  <span class="comment"># anywhere else to look?</span>
  if not declContext.parent:
    error(symbol + " not found")
  <span class="comment"># recursive parent search</span>
  return resolve(symbol, declContext.parent)
</div>
    <p>Complexity:
    &Theta;(n), where n is the number of total scopes.<br>
    Because the result of <code>resolve(symbol, declContext)</code> is invariant
    a program graph may be rewritten by replacing <code>symbol</code> with the results
    of <code>resolve(symbol, declContext)</code>
  </dd>

  <dt>Dynamic scoping</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Resolution via execution context.
    <p>
    <div><img src="graph/scoping-dynamic.gif"></div>
    <p>
    <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> are independent scopes; children of the parent scope in which <code>x</code> is declared.<br>
    <code>f(x)</code> == <code>x</code><br>
    <code>g(f(x))</code> == <code>g.x</code>
    <p>
    Psuedocode:
<div class="psuedocode">resolve(symbol, execContext):
  <span class="comment"># current context</span>
  if execContext.syms[symbol]: 
    return execContext.syms[symbol]
  <span class="comment"># anywhere else to look?</span>
  if not execContext.parent:
    error(symbol + " not found") 
  <span class="comment"># recursive parent search</span>
  return resolve(symbol, execContent.parent) 
</div>
    <p>Complexity:
    &Theta;(n<sup>c</sup>), where n is the number of total scopes and c is the number of
    references to a given scope.
  </dd>

</dl>

<p>
Let a scoped subgraph S(G(P)) be called a Software Object.


<h3>Software Object</h3>

<p>
Informally a Software Object can be defined as an abstract collection
of one or more unique Software Object components for which the
accessibility by other Software Objects is defined by a scoping
algorithm.

<div><img src="graph/software-object-abstract.gif"></div>

<p>
In many programming languages the fundamental Software Objects are fixed-size bit vectors
representing integer, floating point or architecture-specific address types.

<div><img src="graph/software-object-bitvector.gif"></div>


<h3>Type</h3>

<p>
  &lt;Scope&gt; &lt;Type&gt;

<p>
  Language must contain one or more well-defined types.

<p>
  A well-defined type includes definition of storage and
  results of all operations.

<div class="psuedocode">bit equal(Type a, Type b)</div>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
  &lt;Scope&gt; &lt;Type&gt; &lt;Value&gt;

<p>
  With the following requirements:

  <ol type="a">
    <li>Scope
    <ol>
      <li>defined
      <li>valid
    </ol>
    <li>Type
    <ol>
      <li>defined
      <li>compatible with Value
    </ol>
    <li>Value
    <ol>
      <li>defined
      <li>compatible with Type
    </ol>
  </ol>

<p>
  the declaration of a constant/literal value constitutes
  a value "source" vs, which is the first item in a chain of
  one or more value states throughout the lifetime of that
  value.

<p class="unsure">
Value ::= &lt;Storage&gt; | &lt;Literal Or Constant&gt;

  Let Value now refer to any object that yields a value;
  Storage or a Literal or Constant value
</p>

<h3>Storage</h3>

<p>
  &lt;Scope&gt; &lt;Type&gt; &lt;Identifier&gt;

<p>
  Let Storage S(Scope, Type, Identifier) be a software
  object that defines the following interface:

<div class="psuedocode">Value  read(Scope, Type)
()    write(Scope, Type, Value)
</div>

<p>
Such that read() and write() complement each other.
Given:

<div class="psuedocode">V<sub>1</sub> := read(Sc, T)
write(Sc, T, V<sub>1</sub>)
V<sub>2</sub> := read(Sc, T)
</div>

<p>
The following always holds:

<div class="psuedocode">V<sub>1</sub> == V<sub>2</sub></div>

<p>
Informally, that the contents of Storage must be equivalent before and after
a read and then write of itself.

<div class="note">
NOTE: This precludes familiar asynchronous read/write locations from qualifying
as Storage.
<ul>
  <li>Interrupts
  <li>Memory-mapped I/O
  <li class="unsure">libc's <code>errno</code> (actually... i'm not sure if this qualifies or not...)
  <li>POSIX/UNIX's <code>signals</code>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
  Storage declaration must...

  <ol type="a">
    <li>Scope
    <ol>
      <li>defined
      <li>valid
    </ol>
    <li>Type
    <ol>
      <li>defined
      <li>compatible with Value (may be Any)
    </ol>
    <li>Identifier
    <ol>
      <li>be unique as defined by the scoping rules of the language
    </ol>
    <li>Value
    <ol>
      <li>defined
      <li>compatible with Type
    </ol>
  </ol>

<p>
  Storage thus declared must, at a minimum...

  <ol type="a">
    <li>Lifetime/Extent
    <ol>
      <li>it must be possible that storage is written to at least once.
      <li>it must be possible that storage is read from at least once.
    </ol>
  </ol>


<h3>Function(Storage out, Value in)</h3>

<p>
Abstract:

<div class="psuedocode">out &lt;- fn(in)</div>

<p>
  An abstraction whereby input Value(s) are transformed and
  written to Storage out.

<p>
  "Statements" and "Procedures" that operate by "side effects"
  are in fact functions that where the input and output implicitly
  include an entire Scope.

<p>
  Consider:

<div class="psuedocode">i := 1
incr():
  i := i + 1
  print i
incr()
</div>

<p>
  all such programs can be re-written as equivalent function in the following manner:

<div class="psuedocode">parent_scope := ( .out := stdout, .i := 1 )
incr(par_ptr):
  par_ptr-&gt;i := par_ptr-&gt;i + 1
  par_ptr-&gt;out = fprint par_ptr-&gt;out i
incr(&amp;parent_scope)
</div>

<p>
or like so:

<div class="psuedocode">parent_scope := ( .out := stdout, .i := 1 )
incr(p):
  p.i := p.i + 1
  fprint p.out i
  return p
parent_scope = incr(parent_scope)
</div>

<p>
  the point is to illustrate explicitly what happens implicitly in the context
  of a "procedure" -- that 


<h3>Move(Storage dst, Value src)</h3>

<p>
  Overwrite contents of storage dst with value src
  The most fundamental function.

<p>
Abstract

<div class="psuedocode">dst &lt;- src</div>

<ol>
  <li>type compatibility
  <li>if src is storage, it must have been previously written to.
  <li>
    <p>
    dst should not already contain src value
    if it is not possible for dst to contain anything other than
    the value being written to it. consider:

<div class="psuedocode">a := b
a := b
</div>

    <p>
    note that it is the combination of storage location AND value, not
    just storage that is important. consider:

<div class="psuedocode">a := b
b := a
</div>

    <p>
    note that there are many cases where this can appear to happen, but does
    not, because what is being read/written is not Storage because it does not
    meet the requirements for storage
      <ol>
        <li>C's <code>volatile</code>. 'src' may be memory-mapped i/o or something similar
        <li>threaded code. research possibilities.
      </ol>
    <p>

            purpose of copy is to introduce a small delay
            to allow circuit to settle (microcontroller-style)

 </ol>

<pre>

hmm, let's think about control flow.
how do we move between ...
hmm we haven't really defined an abstraction for dealing with expressions/statements

Branch(Location loc)

  foo: goto foo;  /* C                */
  0xeb 0xfe       /* x86 machine code */

Test(Storage dst, Comparison cmp, Value a, Value b)
  FIXME: hmm, is this really fundamental?

Do we want to define functions, in the abstract, mathematical sense?
If I do, I think the whole thing might fall into the lambda calculus area...
which is nice and all, but not where I want to go.

Brainstorm way ahead:
  function must have exactly one entry point
  function must have exactly one exit point
